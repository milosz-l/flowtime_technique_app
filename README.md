# Flowtime technique app
It's super simple and completely free app that let's you easily track work time and automatically calculates break time based on flowtime technique.

## What is the flowtime technique?
It's an alternative for pomodoro technique, where you work for 25 minutes and take 5 minute breaks. With the flowtime technique, your work intervals and breaks are not scheduled. You simply work until youâ€™re distracted or until you feel like you need a break. It allows you to stay focused longer and get into the flow state.

## How the break time is being calculated?
It's 20% of the time you've been working for. It's that simple! So if you need to take a break after 25 minutes you will have a 5 minute break - just like in Pomodoro technique. Alternatively, if you get distracted after 10 minutes, you will have a 2 minute break. However in case you went full on into a flow state and managed to keep focused for whole 90 minutes, you will get an 18 minute break! That's why I think the flowtime technique is a better and more flexible alternative to the pomodoro technique.
